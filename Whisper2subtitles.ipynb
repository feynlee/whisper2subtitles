            "value": " If I'm doing a stage show and I have to sometimes use these techniques very rapidly with somebody,\n then I can normally tell by the way they catch a frisbee if I'm throwing a frisbee out to\n choose people and how they're responding in that moment.\n I can normally get a good sense of then how they'll be up on stage.\n But in general life, when there's all sorts of other things going on, it's much harder\n to be of any sense of like, oh, that's a good person.\n Because who you are.\n Your very sense of self is so dependent on the context that you're in.\n I mean, I've had this from day one.\n You know, I did a show called The Push, which involved somebody getting pushed off a building.\n And could you manipulate somebody to do that, to kill somebody just through social compliance?\n And I used to hear all the time people say, well, I'd never do that.\n I wouldn't work on me.\n But your very sense of who you are is so fluid and extends into your environment.\n And that person's saying that when they're sat at home watching the TV, but that's not\n the same version of themselves that's in that situation on the roof after everything that's\n been going on.\n So it's very hard to make any, I think, statements about what a person is or how they'll behave.\n The more I do it, the more nuanced all that becomes.\n So it's very hard to tie it in with anything else other than a sort of emotional openness.\n And we'll have that in some situations and not others.\n Like I'm not a very good hypnotic subject on stage.\n And if someone's trying to hypnotize me, I tend not to be very good at it.\n But probably, if I might respond really well to a placebo with a doctor or absorb someone's\n opinion, someone that I really respect, if it's an expert on something and I really admire\n them, I might find myself just absorbing their ideas and power to them as my own the next\n day, which is another form of suggestibility.\n So yeah, so largely it doesn't.\n Because I think if you walked around trying to be as controlling as that version of me\n that is on TV and so on is, you'd be kind of insufferable.\n And actually, if anything, I've made my life about not trying to control the things that\n I'm not in control of, hence the interest in services.\n It's a story thing, you're right.\n It's all about getting it.\n My toolkit I've always felt is the stories that other people tell themselves.\n That's sort of what I'm working with, whether that's actually to do with how we find happiness\n and those sorts of thoughts, or whether it's if you're doing a car trick or something.\n But it's the same kind of thing.\n One of the big ideas of stoicism, which is not an unfamiliar idea to us at all, because\n it's the stoics were the very people that the early Christians had to win over.\n So a lot of the ideas have come up over the last 2000 years and are with us still.\n But the idea that it isn't events in the world that cause our problems, but it's our judgments\n about those events.\n And that's where our problems really come from.\n So it's about the stories we tell ourselves about the world.\n And what a silly car trick, if it fools us and works, and not just stoicism, but really\n the best ways of approaching life and the most healthy ways of approaching life, having\n common is this idea that we are just dealing with a story.\n So if a magician shows you a trick and it works, and it took me years to realize this,\n that there's actually something grown up and worthwhile in this really childish attention\n seeking desire to impress people that is magic.\n But the grown up thought in it is it's showing us that the stories we're creating about what's\n happening in the world are not reality.\n Because we're hitting a sort of a wall and we're going, oh, something must have happened.\n I don't know what it was.\n But I've got this story that all seems to make sense until I get to the end and now\n it's sort of impossible.\n And of course, this is what we do every life, you know, every day of our lives.\n The idea of a story.\n Stories are told across a campfire and they're cozy things and then outside of that campfire\n you've got all this forest, all this dark stuff in it that's being excluded from that\n story.\n It's the nature of stories that they exclude so much.\n It's also the nature of the things that we exclude from our own story that will come back\n and bite us.\n They gain a sort of energy.\n It's like in the fairy stories it's the banished, the banished God, well not God mother, but\n the evil figure that's banished from the christening that comes and lays her curse on the baby.\n And now the baby grows up with this curse.\n It's like a part of this, the shadow side, you would say, that's been banished and it's\n gained a power.\n It's the person that gets banished in the fairy stories and lives in exile and then\n comes back fortified with armies.\n It's always the part of us that we try and get rid of, that we try to bury, that ultimately\n gains a power.\n Things that own us, the things that we're not conscious of and we don't try to integrate.\n So that whole world I find interesting, I find interesting the world of the stories we tell\n ourselves about the world because that's where we get any sort of leverage to change our experience\n of the world is in the story we tell about it.\n And weirdly a magic trick is sort of a great analogy for that because it is going, the\n story you just told yourself cannot be what actually happened.\n It's just so obvious but we forget it because we mistake our field of vision for the horizons\n of the world.\n Well first of all I don't really consider myself a stoic.\n I'm slightly allergic to, I can't really identify with anything perhaps, but I do find\n the ideas very valuable.\n I think the experience of being a bit well known and all that sort of stuff doesn't really\n matter because the part of the problem is that we search for happiness and we put it\n in the wrong places because we have this, we do have a desire to transcend our ordinary\n experience that is part of the human urge and we tend to put it in the wrong places\n because we've lost touch with any of the kind of mythological superstitious world over\n the last few hundred years.\n We're left with not really knowing where to put that need to find the thing that's bigger\n than ourself so we put it in fame and money and success and blah blah blah.\n But they're all really bad places to put it because they don't provide it, they just don't.\n I really do try and stick to that idea that the things you're in control of are your thoughts\n and your actions and the other stuff, what other people do and outcomes, you have no\n control over.\n If you try and control those things that you can't, you just, you're just going to make\n yourself anxious and get frustrated.\n And then there's this interesting area in the middle when you're partly in control.\n So like if you're playing a game of tennis, this is a good analogy I think, if you go\n in thinking I must win, you're trying to control an outcome, I will win this game, you're\n going to get anxious if your opponent's better than you and you find yourself losing.\n As if you go in thinking I'll play as well as I can, I'll play to the best of my ability,\n then if your opponent starts to beat you, you're not going to feel like you're failing\n because you're not, you can still succeed in your aims.\n So it's high in tension but low expectation I think is useful.\n And all of that stuff I do find, I think it's really good advice.\n I don't think it's the answer to everything because it doesn't have much to say about\n compassion and kindness, it doesn't have much to say about the value of anxiety.\n It can run the risk of, the whole model of happiness is you're avoiding unnecessary anxiety,\n avoiding unnecessary disturbance by only trying to control the things you're in control of\n and detaching yourself from things you have no control over.\n And you can feel in that there is the seed of sort of disengagement and that something\n will get lacked in there.\n But it depends how you live it and what you make it for yourself and I guess everybody\n finds their own route through it.\n But I think I'm constitutionally disposed to it.\n I think if you're not, if you're quite an anxious type of person or someone that wants\n to kind of fix things and that's your kind of way in the world, it probably would be\n very hard to take any of that stuff on board.\n It's sort of in a way, it's not, I don't think it's a plausible task because it's like trying\n to, it's just sort of part of our personalities.\n And I think if you see it in terms of people being pliable or being easily led, then of\n course it sounds quite a negative thing and of course we should try and be less like that\n and we should be more ourselves and be the author of our own stories and all of course.\n But equally another way of seeing it is sort of an openness and a kind of a, an ability\n to make emotional connections and to be, you know, present to an extent, that's all part\n of it.\n So, I think that for anything else, I think the people that are more suggestible tend\n to be more likeable.\n I think there's, they just have a natural sort of tendency to connect with people and\n people feel that.\n So I've never seen it as a sort of a weakness.\n I tend to see it as a strength because I know I tend to warm to people that are like that.\n I think, and again, it's not, suggestibility doesn't mean responding to hypnosis on stage.\n It doesn't, it doesn't just mean being made to do things you don't want to do.\n That's one little bit of it, but it is, it's a whole, there's a whole layer of our experience\n as to how our sense of self has bled out into our surroundings and found its footing in our\n relationships and the environment that we're in and that's all part of it.\n That's all part of what makes us suggestible and that's a really, that's just part of the\n human experience.\n And again, if we try not, if we try and shut that out, it will somehow come back and bite\n us because it is an ordinary part of the human experience.\n I think it's a good thing to embrace.\n And I should also say all the people that are taking part of this, I've stayed friends\n with them, properly kept in touch with them and it has not credited the shows with this,\n but it's all been good for, you know, how their lives have continued.\n There's been no sort of negative response to the shows at all.\n The only story as you're watching it that probably doesn't have that is the push, the\n one that I mentioned, because when you watch it, you are of course left thinking, but what\n about those people that just, so if you haven't seen the show, it's a big, like this sort\n of Truman Show type thing that I guess I do a bit of that one guy, we think we're following\n one guy who is, finds himself in this big hidden camera experiment full of actors.\n He doesn't realize they're all actors and it's being filmed and it's a big party, a\n big kind of auction and the whole thing is designed.\n Somebody dies and then they have to hide the body and then bit by bit it gets the point\n that the guy wasn't dead and now he's alive again and will he kill it?\n Will he push him off a roof to avoid imprisonment?\n So and then you find out at the end, he doesn't do it, but four other people did and we actually\n did the whole thing four times.\n There is this surprise ending which I've just ruined if you haven't seen it, when you realize\n that other people did do it and most people will do it.\n So you're not the first person to think, what about those other people?\n What if they're going to have a job interview or something?\n You didn't, you pushed someone off a roof in a TV show, so why would we give this job\n to you?\n That's a perfectly good question.\n I don't have a watertight answer for it, other than it's their experience, so the guy that\n doesn't push, his experience of course is great, I didn't push brilliant, so I'm a good\n guy and then for the others you just want to make sure that they understand and what\n their experience is and this is a very specific debriefing with them afterwards, you have\n done what everybody does, what three quarters of people do, which is push when it comes\n to it, build this stuff in place.\n You've done the ordinary human thing, so first of all you're not the exception, you're not\n the bad person, nothing wrong with you, you've done what people do, but you are now equipped,\n if you ever were to find yourself, probably not going to be in a situation this extreme,\n but a situation where that sort of compliance is in the air, you are now equipped to not\n just stand by and let it happen, there's a great, you know when a fire alarm goes and\n you just, instinctively we just ignore it, because no one else is panicking, so the one\n thing you know is there's not actually a fire, or you're looking to see what other people\n are doing, there's a thing called normalcy bias and the worst example that was an aeroplane\n that landed at Tenerife and it was a Pan Am flight and it landed, it was foggy, it was\n a foggy night time thing and another plane was taking off and they were trying to get,\n it was on the same runway, so the two were going to collide and they were trying to get\n this first plane off but they couldn't communicate and this plane took off but sort of plowed\n into the other one at the same time and ripped off half of the bottom plane, right, that's\n on the tarmac and these people had about two minutes to get out before this plane was going\n to be engulfed in fire and people just sat there, they sat there with their seat belts\n on, sort of glassy eyed, waiting for somebody else to panic or do something, there's this\n thing that we just, presume it's going to be fine or that it won't affect us or it's\n just this bias that we have, but the people that didn't, the people that got off, or the\n people that either been in a situation like that before or the ones that sort of had some\n training in that kind of thing, so they were kind of like mentally rehearsed for it, so\n that became what these people had and they're very clear on that, that is absolutely, their\n story, their experience with the thing is that, like they learned something that would\n be really valuable in life and none of them have had that experience with them, job interviews\n and so on.\n I think I am, I think my tendency would be to not, to sort of manage that, to sort of\n manage my kind of immediate emotional response to stuff, particularly if it's a negative\n thing, if it's feeling like anxiety or whatever, just to sort of, I'm naturally quite good at\n avoiding those things and don't tend to feel stressed about things, but then I do, I still\n happens, it still comes around, I still feel it, but in the most direct ways where it's\n obvious, I'm normally quite good at circumventing it, but then you know these things often have\n a way of surprising you, you know, so my partner had a few years over lockdown of not working,\n so that's something that affected him, so therefore it affected me, so that, even though\n my experience with lockdown was kind of fine because I was good at not finding it a source\n of anxiety, it was still going to, came back to me through my relationship, so these things\n still get us.\n I think also at the age of 50, thank you I know, but at 50 there is a thing, I think\n that happens in the second half of life where you naturally should, in inverted commas,\n turn your attention more to how you sit with yourself, I think there is a general project\n of the first half of life, which is where you stand or sit in the world, what you're\n kind of, there is a dialogue with the world, you are placing your flag in the world, so\n you're interested in cues from outsiders to what counts as success, what you should do,\n what affects your reputation, who you are, what your identity is, there is a lot of kind\n of dialogue with the outside world, and then there is a thing that I think should naturally\n happen in the second half, which is that sort of forward drive, which keeps us motivated\n in the first half, you never quite get to those places that you're always trying to\n push to, switches to a dialogue more with the self and how you sit more with yourself,\n so things that bring pleasure and rewards sort of in the moment actually become probably\n more valuable in the second half of life than they are in the first, you probably should\n become less interested in what can I do to advance myself in this world, it's not about\n being complacent, it's just a shift in emphasis, I think that's sort of a healthy, positive\n kind of natural current, so I think as I get older, I'm much more aware of those things\n as well, I think in terms of my own place, but that isn't about controlling my own mind\n or controlling my own states and making sure I'm always mentally in a good place, it's\n much more about how you pay attention to your life and we get very caught up in the big\n things and the big goals, and actually when we look back on life, it's all the little\n stuff, that actually is sort of what adds up to the life, it's not the big things that\n we were aiming for, it will be all the little meaningless in between bits, oh that was, that's\n what it was, you'll feel that it's your ambition and your goals and your plans that are going\n to move you forward, but at the same time you'll look back and realize oh it wasn't\n that, it was a bunch of full starts and the things that actually got me moving forward\n were people I met and connections that I made, which were nothing to do with my plans, actually\n not really, I mean there's a certain amount that you're nudging that one way or the other,\n but it wasn't really all the things that I thought it was at the time, so and the time\n isn't, you can never have the control over it that you think you're supposed to, the\n idea of a work-life balance, it's just sort of, that doesn't make it, there is no such\n thing, there's just, we come to see time as a sort of a resource, we talk about it like\n it's something we spend or use up or waste and that's a very modern way of thinking about\n time, that's only really comes into the industrial revolution and actually it's just the medium\n through which life unfolds, that's all it is, it's into resource and I think those are\n the, those kind, I think you just sort of lean a little differently, at least I do,\n into some of those ideas, so that is about an awareness, I guess of my mind and my place\n in the world, but it isn't about controlling my mental state in your way that maybe I thought\n it was when I first started, when I was trying to retain a sort of mind-master kind of distance\n and thing, that's just, there's no way of living at all, I think actually how you do\n connect and what you lean into and where you find meaning and those things are ultimately\n proved to be more important.\n I think the most useful sort of nugget of anything that I think I've taken from writing\n the book Happy is, the subtitle of it is, why more or less everything is absolutely fine\n and I think that's the biggest lesson of it for me is that all the stuff we can't control,\n that's everything outside of our thoughts and our actions, everything else is actually\n fine, the bits we can't control are fine for them to be as they are, which sounds like\n a recipe for complacency but it isn't because you can devote your life to changing things\n that you see that are wrong in the world, but that's all the stuff, the stuff you're\n in control of is you putting your energy and your devotion into that and creating that\n change, great because that's stuff you're in control of, what you're not in control\n of is the outcome because that might happen like a generation after you've gone for example,\n so and if you get too caught up in the outcome, you're going to get better, it's going to\n get in the way, right?\n So the ideal state is high expectation, so high intention, low expectation, same thing,\n so it does keep coming down to that division of the things, the bits you're not actually\n in control of, they're fine as they are and I think I have found that a really helpful\n thing to just suddenly go, oh hang on a minute, which side of the line is this thing that's\n bothering me on, is it the stuff I'm in control of or is it other stuff?\n And it's always the other stuff.\n So yeah, so it's not to say that you don't find the bits that maybe you are in control\n of that you can still like, you know, put stuff out there but you're just separating\n it from the bits that you're not.\n So those bits are fine and nothing bad happens if you leave them and I think having a sort\n of, letting that drip in by trying it with the little things and then letting it sort\n of settle in as an idea to actually have a bit of faith in almost, I think is that,\n I found that very, that's a helpful thing because it's like somebody saying, you know,\n it's fine, it's okay, in fact it is literally somebody saying that because I just said it.\n Yes, and present whenever.\n And I was just wondering whether you ever had like a sick, sadistic desire to mess around\n with individuals in your own life for your own personal gain?\n I really don't, I mean it's so disappointing but it comes down to that thing of, if I lived\n like that, it would just, it would be insufferable for me and everybody else, it would, it would,\n it's just no if living a life, it's the opposite of the sort of stoic approach of not trying\n to control things you can't control like other people.\n So no, I mean I'm banned from casinos in the country but that's not because I was doing\n anything or just once I got, you know, recognized and then one place said no, thank you, then\n I'm on their system and so all the other casinos that use the same security system, if I try\n and walk into one, they say, oh no, sorry, you can eat the food but you can't play the\n game.\n So, you know, why did I mention casinos?\n It's just, yeah, I'm not out there doing the stuff in life because it's not really, I don't\n think, any way to live.\n And I think that generally most of the stuff that I read, it's all sort of these techniques,\n seduction techniques, how to make people whatever feel that they're, you know, how to act like\n you're listening to somebody and just listen, just listen to the person.\n You don't have to mirror their body language and do these, if you listen to somebody, these\n things will come naturally.\n If you want someone to like you, just, you know, it'd be nice and so on.\n So I, that whole world of sort of going out into the world with, with a sort of bunch\n of techniques to control it is really misguided.\n I was like that for a long time and I think maybe it's partly reacting against that but\n maybe I have to kind of go through it to then realize, oh, that's not, that's not the point."

            "value": "如果我在做舞台表演，有时我必须非常迅速地对某人使用这些技巧。\n 那么我通常可以通过他们接住飞盘的方式来判断，如果我把飞盘扔出去是为了\n 选择人，以及他们在那一刻是如何反应的。\n 然后我通常可以很好地感觉到他们在舞台上会是怎样。\n 但在一般的生活中，当有各种其他事情发生时，就更难了\n 要有任何感觉，比如说，哦，那是一个好人。\n 因为你是谁。\n 你的自我意识是如此依赖于你所处的环境。\n 我的意思是，我从第一天起就有这种感觉。\n 你知道，我做了一个叫 \"推 \"的节目，其中涉及有人被推下楼。\n 你能通过社会顺应性来操纵别人去做，去杀人吗？\n 我过去一直听到人们说，好吧，我绝不会这么做。\n 我不会对我自己起作用。\n 但你对自己是谁的感觉是如此不稳定，并延伸到你的环境中。\n 当那个人坐在家里看电视的时候，他是这么说的，但那并不是\n 但是，在经历了所有的事情之后，在屋顶上的那个版本的自己并不是这样的。\n 进展情况。\n 因此，我认为很难对一个人是什么或他们将如何表现做出任何陈述。\n 我做得越多，这一切就变得越微妙。\n 因此，除了一种情感上的开放，很难将其与其他东西联系起来。\n 而且我们在某些情况下会有这种感觉，而在其他情况下则没有。\n 比如我在舞台上不是一个很好的催眠对象。\n 如果有人试图催眠我，我往往不是很擅长。\n 但是，如果我可能对医生的安慰剂反应很好，或者吸收某人的\n 的意见，如果是我非常尊重的人，如果是某方面的专家，而且我非常钦佩\n 他们，我可能会发现自己只是吸收他们的想法和权力，他们作为我自己的第二天\n 这是另一种形式的暗示性。\n 所以，是的，所以很大程度上它没有。\n 因为我认为，如果你四处走动，试图成为像电视上的那个版本的我一样的控制力\n 电视上的那个版本的我，你就会让人无法忍受。\n 实际上，如果有的话，我的生活就是不要试图控制那些我无法控制的事情。\n 我无法控制的事情，因此我对服务感兴趣。\n 这是个故事，你是对的。\n 这都是为了得到它。\n 我一直觉得我的工具箱是别人告诉自己的故事。\n 这就是我的工作，无论这实际上是与我们如何找到幸福有关的\n 和这些想法，或者是你在做一个汽车技巧或其他什么。\n 但这是同一类的事情。\n 斯多葛主义的一个重要思想，对我们来说一点都不陌生，因为\n 因为斯多葛派正是早期基督教徒必须争取的人。\n 所以很多想法在过去的2000年里出现了，并且仍然伴随着我们。\n 但是，导致我们问题的不是世界上的事件，而是我们对这些事件的判断。\n 对这些事件的判断。\n而这正是我们的问题的真正来源。\n 所以这是关于我们告诉自己关于世界的故事。\n 多么愚蠢的汽车把戏，如果它骗过了我们并起了作用，而不仅仅是委曲求全，而是真的\n 最好的生活方式和最健康的生活方式，都有一个共同点。\n 共同的是这种想法，我们只是在处理一个故事。\n 因此，如果一个魔术师给你看了一个把戏，而且成功了，我花了很多年才意识到这一点。\n 在这种非常幼稚的关注中，实际上有一些成熟的、有价值的东西\n 寻求给人留下深刻印象的欲望，这就是魔术。\n 但其中的成熟思想是，它向我们表明，我们所创造的关于世界上发生的事情的故事\n 发生在这个世界上的故事并不是现实。\n 因为我们遇到了一种墙，我们会说，哦，一定发生了什么。\n 我不知道那是什么。\n 但我有这个故事，所有的事情似乎都是有意义的，直到我到了最后，现在\n 它有点不可能。\n 当然，这就是我们每个人的生活，你知道，我们生活的每一天。\n 一个故事的想法。\n 故事是在篝火上讲的，它们是舒适的东西，然后在篝火外面\n 你有所有这些森林，所有这些黑暗的东西都被排除在故事之外。\n 故事。\n 这就是故事的本质，它们排除了很多东西。\n 这也是我们从自己的故事中排除的东西的性质，会回来\n 并咬我们。\n 它们获得一种能量。\n 就像在童话故事中，被放逐的，被放逐的上帝，好吧，不是神母，而是\n 被放逐的邪恶人物在洗礼中出现，对婴儿下了诅咒。\n 现在婴儿带着这个诅咒长大了。\n 这就像其中的一部分，你会说是影子的一面，它被放逐了，它获得了一种力量。\n 获得了一种力量。\n 这就是童话故事中被放逐的人，在流放中生活，然后\n 然后带着军队回来了。\n 它总是我们试图摆脱的部分，我们试图埋葬的部分，最终\n 获得一种力量。\n 拥有我们的东西，那些我们没有意识到的东西，我们没有尝试去整合。\n 所以整个世界我觉得很有趣，我觉得我们告诉自己的关于世界的故事的世界很有趣\n 因为那是我们获得任何种类的杠杆来改变我们对世界的体验的地方\n 我们对这个世界的经验，是在我们讲述的故事里。\n 奇怪的是，魔术是一个很好的比喻，因为它是这样的\n 你刚刚告诉自己的故事不可能是实际发生的事情。\n 这是很明显的，但我们忘记了，因为我们把我们的视野误认为是世界的视野。\n 世界的视野。\n 首先，我不认为自己是一个坚忍的人。\n 我有点过敏，也许我不能真正认同什么，但我确实发现\n 这些想法非常有价值。\n 我认为被人熟知的经验和所有这些东西其实并不重要。\n 因为问题的一部分是我们在寻找幸福，而我们把它放在错误的地方，因为我们有这样的想法。\n 在错误的地方，因为我们有这个，我们确实有一个超越我们普通经验的愿望\n 我们确实有一种超越我们普通经验的愿望，这是人类冲动的一部分，我们倾向于把它放在错误的地方\n 因为在过去的几百年里，我们已经与任何一种神话般的迷信世界失去了联系\n 在过去的几百年里，我们已经失去了与任何神话迷信世界的联系。\n 我们不知道该把这种需要放在哪里，以找到比自己更大的东西。\n 所以我们把它放在名声、金钱和成功上，等等等等。\n 但它们都是非常糟糕的地方，因为它们不能提供它，它们就是不能。\n 我真的尝试并坚持这个想法，你能控制的东西是你的思想\n 和你的行动，其他的东西，其他人的行为和结果，你都无法\n 控制的。\n 如果你试图控制那些你无法控制的东西，你只是，你只是要让自己焦虑和沮丧。\n 你只会让自己焦虑和沮丧。\n 然后在中间有一个有趣的区域，当你有部分控制权。\n 所以，如果你在打一场网球，我想这是一个很好的比喻，如果你去\n 如果你认为我必须赢，你试图控制一个结果，我将赢得这场比赛，你会\n 如果你的对手比你强，而你发现自己输了，你就会变得焦虑不安。\n 如果你去想我将尽可能地打好，我将发挥我的能力。\n 那么如果你的对手开始击败你，你就不会觉得你失败了\n 因为你没有，你仍然可以成功实现你的目标。\n 因此，它的紧张程度高，但期望值低，我认为是有用的。\n 所有这些东西我都觉得，我认为这是非常好的建议。\n我不认为它是一切的答案，因为它对慈悲和善良没有什么可说的。\n compassion and kindness, it doesn't have much to say about the value of anxiety. 怜悯和仁慈，它对焦虑的价值没有什么可说的。\n 它可能会有这样的风险，整个幸福的模式是你在避免不必要的焦虑。\n 避免不必要的干扰，只试图控制你能控制的事情\n 并把自己从你无法控制的事情中分离出来。\n 而你可以感觉到，这里面有一种脱离的种子，而且有一些东西\n 将会在那里缺乏。\n 但这取决于你如何生活，你为自己做什么，我想每个人都会\n 我想每个人都能通过它找到自己的路线。\n 但我认为我在宪法上是倾向于它的。\n 我认为如果你不是，如果你是一个相当焦虑的人，或者是一个想要\n 想解决一些事情，这是你在世界上的一种方式，它可能会是\n 就很难接受这些东西。\n 在某种程度上，这不是，我不认为这是一个合理的任务，因为这就像试图\n 这只是我们性格的一部分。\n 我认为，如果你把它看作是人的柔顺或容易被引导，那么\n 当然，这听起来是一个相当消极的事情，当然我们应该尝试少一些这样的事情\n 我们应该做更多的自己，成为我们自己故事的作者，当然，所有这些。\n 但同样地，另一种看法是一种开放性和一种，一种能力\n 进行情感连接，并且在某种程度上，你知道，存在，这都是它的一部分。\n 它的一部分。\n 所以，我认为，对于其他任何事情，我认为更容易受暗示的人倾向于\n 往往更讨人喜欢。\n 我认为，他们只是有一种自然的倾向，与人沟通，人们感觉到。\n 人们感觉到了这一点。\n 所以我从来没有把它看作是一种弱点。\n 我倾向于将其视为一种优势，因为我知道我倾向于对这样的人热情。\n 我认为，再说一遍，这不是，暗示性并不意味着对舞台上的催眠有反应。\n 它不，它不只是意味着被强迫做你不想做的事情。\n 这只是其中的一小部分，但它是一个整体，我们的经验有一个完整的层次\n 我们的自我意识是如何渗入到我们的环境中，并在我们的关系和环境中找到它的立足点。\n 关系和我们所处的环境，这都是它的一部分。\n 这都是使我们受到暗示的一部分，这真的是，这只是人类经验的一部分。\n 人类经验的一部分。\n 再说一遍，如果我们不尝试，如果我们尝试把它拒之门外，它就会以某种方式回来咬我们。\n 因为它是人类经验的一个普通部分。\n 我认为这是一个值得拥抱的好东西。\n 我还应该说，所有参加这个活动的人，我都是他们的朋友，与他们保持适当的联系。\n 我和他们保持着朋友关系，和他们保持着适当的联系，这并不意味着这些节目有什么用。\n 但这一切都很好，你知道，他们的生活如何继续。\n 对这些节目根本没有任何负面反应。\n 你在看的时候，唯一的故事可能没有，就是我提到的那个推动。\n 我提到的那个，因为当你看它的时候，你当然会想，但是那些人呢？\n 如果你没有看过这个节目，这是一个大的，就像这种楚门秀式的事情。\n 我想我做的是一个人，我们认为我们是在跟随一个人，但他发现自己陷入了困境。\n 一个人发现自己在这个大型的隐藏式摄像机实验中，里面都是演员。\n 他没有意识到他们都是演员，而且正在被拍摄，这是一个大的聚会，一个大的拍卖会。\n 一个大型的拍卖会，整个过程都是设计好的。\n 有人死了，然后他们必须把尸体藏起来，然后一点一点地让人明白\n 那个人并没有死，现在他又活过来了，他要杀了他吗？\n 他会把他从屋顶上推下去以避免入狱吗？\n 所以，最后你发现，他没有做，但其他四个人做了。\n 我们实际上做了整整四次。\n 有一个令人惊讶的结局，如果你没有看过，我已经毁了，当你意识到\n 其他人确实做了，而且大多数人都会这样做。\n 所以你不是第一个想到，那些其他人怎么办？\n 如果他们要有一个工作面试或什么的怎么办？\n 你没有，你在电视剧中把人推下屋顶，那么我们为什么要把这份工作给\n 给你？\n 这是个非常好的问题。\n我没有一个无懈可击的答案，只能说这是他们的经验。\n 不推的人，他的经验当然很好，我没有推得很好，所以我是个好人。\n 然后对于其他人，你只是想确保他们理解，以及他们的经验是什么。\n 他们的经验是什么，这是一个非常具体的事后汇报。\n 你已经做了每个人都会做的事情，四分之三的人都会做的事情，那就是在事情发生时推动\n 来，把这些东西建立起来。\n 你已经做了普通人的事情，所以首先你不是例外，你不是\n 你不是坏人，你没有任何问题，你已经做了人们所做的事情，但你现在有了装备。\n 如果你曾经发现自己，可能不会是在这种极端的情况下。\n 但在这种情况下，你现在有能力去做了。\n 你现在有能力不袖手旁观，让它发生，有一个很大的，你知道当一个火警警报响起，你只是，本能地我们只是，让它发生。\n 你只是，本能地，我们只是忽略它，因为没有其他人恐慌，所以有一点你知道的是，没有一个人是不知道的。\n 你知道的是，实际上并没有发生火灾，或者你想看看其他人在做什么。\n 有一种东西叫正常偏差，最糟糕的例子是一架飞机\n 那是一架降落在特内里费岛的飞机，是泛美航空的航班，它降落时有雾，那是一个有雾的夜晚。\n 有雾的夜晚，另一架飞机正在起飞，他们正试图进入。\n 它在同一条跑道上，所以这两架飞机要相撞，他们试图让第一架飞机起飞，但他们无法做到。\n 他们试图让第一架飞机起飞，但他们无法沟通，这架飞机起飞了，但同时也撞上了另一架飞机。\n 撞上了另一架飞机，并撕掉了底部飞机的一半，对，那是在停机坪上。\n 在停机坪上，这些人有大约两分钟的时间离开，然后这架飞机就会被大火吞噬。\n 在飞机被大火吞噬之前，人们只是坐在那里，他们系着安全带坐在那里\n 他们坐在那里，系着安全带，目光呆滞，等着别人惊慌失措或做些什么，有这样一个\n 我们只是，假定它将会很好，或者它不会影响我们，或者这只是我们的偏见。\n 只是我们有这样的偏见，但那些没有的人，那些下车的人，或者那些曾经遇到过类似情况的人。\n 的人，要么是在这样的情况下，或那些排序有一些训练\n 在这种事情的训练，所以他们有点像精神上的排练，所以\n 因此，这些人就变成了这样，他们非常清楚，这绝对是，他们的故事，他们的经历。\n 他们的故事，他们对这件事的经验是，就像他们学到了一些东西，在生活中会非常有价值\n 在生活中是非常有价值的，他们没有一个人有这样的经验，工作面试\n 等等。\n 我想我是，我想我的倾向是不，管理这个，管理我的那种直接的情绪反应。\n 管理我对事物的直接情绪反应，特别是如果它是一个负面的东西\n 特别是如果它是一个负面的东西，如果它感觉像焦虑或什么，只是排序，我自然很擅长\n 避免这些事情，不倾向于对事情感到压力，但后来我做的，我仍然\n 发生，它仍然会出现，我仍然感觉到它，但在最直接的方式，它是\n 很明显，我通常很善于规避它，但你知道这些事情往往有\n 你知道的，所以我的伙伴有几年时间没有工作。\n 所以那件事影响了他，所以也影响了我，所以，尽管\n 我的禁闭经验是一种罚款，因为我是好的，没有发现它的一个来源\n 焦虑的来源，但它仍然会，通过我的关系回来找我，所以这些东西\n 还是会影响我们。\n我认为在50岁的时候，谢谢你，我知道，但在50岁的时候有一件事，我认为\n 发生在生命的后半段，你自然应该，用倒数的逗号。\n 把你的注意力更多地转向你如何与自己相处，我认为有一个一般的项目\n 我认为前半生有一个总的项目，那就是你在这个世界上的位置，你是什么？\n 样，与世界进行对话，你把你的旗帜放在世界中，所以\n 你对外人的提示感兴趣，什么才算成功，你应该做什么。\n 什么会影响你的声誉，你是谁，你的身份是什么，有很多种\n 与外部世界的对话，然后有一件事，我认为应该自然地发生在后半部分。\n 然后有一件事，我认为应该在下半场自然而然地发生，这就是那种前进的动力，它使我们有动力\n 在前半部分，你从来没有完全到达那些你一直试图去的地方\n 推动，转而与自我进行更多的对话，以及你如何更多地与自己坐在一起。\n 因此，那些在当下带来快乐和回报的事情，实际上可能在人生的后半段变得\n 在生命的后半段比在前半段更有价值，你可能应该\n 你可能应该对我能做什么来提高自己在这个世界上的地位不那么感兴趣，这并不是关于\n 这不是自满，只是重点的转移，我认为这是一种健康、积极的自然趋势。\n 我认为这是一种健康、积极的自然趋势，所以我认为随着我年龄的增长，我对这些事情更加了解了\n 所以我认为随着年龄的增长，我对这些事情的认识也越来越多，我认为就我自己的位置而言，但这并不是要控制我自己的思想\n 或控制我自己的状态，并确保我在精神上总是处于一个良好的状态，它是\n 它更多的是关于你如何关注你的生活，我们会被大事情和大目标所吸引。\n 我们被大的事情和大的目标所吸引，而实际上当我们回顾生活时，所有的小事都是\n 的东西，实际上是对生活的一种补充，它不是我们的目标的大事情。\n 我们的目标不是大事情，而是所有中间的无意义的小事情，哦，那是，那是什么？\n 你会觉得是你的野心、你的目标和你的计划将\n 你会觉得是你的雄心壮志和你的目标以及你的计划在推动你前进，但同时你会回过头来，意识到哦，这并不是\n 它是一堆完整的开始，而实际上让我前进的东西是我遇到的人和我的关系。\n 是我遇到的人和我建立的联系，这些都与我的计划无关，实际上\n 不是真的，我的意思是有一定的量，你在推动这种方式或其他。\n 但这并不是我当时所认为的所有事情，所以，现在的时间不是。\n 所以，时间不是，你永远无法控制它，你认为你应该，工作和生活的平衡的想法。\n 工作和生活的平衡的想法，它只是排序，这并不使它，有没有这样的事情\n 我们把时间看作是一种资源，我们谈论它就像\n 我们谈论它就像我们花掉或用掉或浪费的东西，这是一种非常现代的思考方式\n 这是一种非常现代的思考方式，只有在工业革命中才真正出现，实际上它只是一个媒介\n 实际上，它只是生活的媒介，它就是这样，它是一种资源，我认为这些是\n 我认为那些，那些种类，我认为你只是有点不同的倾向，至少我是这样。\n 这些想法，所以这是关于一个意识，我想我的思想和我的位置\n 在这个世界上，但它不是关于控制我的精神状态的方式，也许我认为\n 当我刚开始的时候，当我试图保持一种心灵主宰的距离时，它是。\n 和事情，那只是，根本没有生活的方式，我认为实际上你如何做\n 我认为实际上你如何连接，你靠什么，你在哪里找到意义，这些东西最终被证明是更重要的。\n 被证明是更重要的。\n 我认为，我从写作中得到的最有用的东西是\n 这本书《快乐》的副标题是，为什么或多或少所有的东西都是绝对好的\n 我想这是它给我的最大教训是，所有我们无法控制的东西。\n 那是我们的思想和行动之外的一切，其他一切实际上都是\n 很好，我们无法控制的部分对它们来说是很好的，这听起来像是自满的秘诀。\n 这听起来像是自满的秘诀，但它不是，因为你可以用你的生命来改变你看到的错误的事情。\n 你看到的世界上错误的事情，但那是所有的东西，你能控制的东西\n 你可以控制的东西是你把你的能量和你的奉献投入到其中，并创造这种\n 变化，很好，因为那是你能控制的东西，你不能控制的是结果。\n 的是结果，因为这可能会发生，比如说在你走后的一代。\n 所以，如果你太过关注结果，你会变得更好，它将会\n 妨碍，对吗？\n所以理想状态是高期望值，所以高意图，低期望值，同样的事情。\n 因此，它确实一直归结为对事物的划分，那些你实际上无法控制的部分\n 我认为我发现这对我很有帮助。\n 我觉得我发现这真的很有帮助，就是突然间，哦，等一下，这个东西是在哪一边的？\n 困扰我的，是我能控制的东西还是其他东西？\n 而它总是其他的东西。\n 所以，是的，所以这并不是说你找不到那些也许你能控制的部分。\n 你仍然可以像，你知道，把东西放在那里，但你只是把它从你的位子中分离出来。\n 但你只是把它与你无法控制的部分分开。\n 因此，那些位子是好的，如果你离开它们，没有什么坏事发生，我认为有一种\n 我认为，通过在小事情上的尝试，让它滴入，然后让它排序\n 作为一个想法，实际上有一点信心，我认为是这样。\n 我发现这很有帮助，因为这就像有人说，你知道的。\n 这很好，这很好，事实上，这确实是有人在说，因为我刚刚说了。\n 是的，而且无论何时都在。\n 我只是想知道，你是否曾经有一种病态的、虐待狂的欲望，为了你自己的生活而乱来\n 为了你自己的个人利益而与个人打交道？\n 我真的没有，我的意思是它是如此令人失望，但它归结为一件事，如果我这样生活\n 那样的话，我和其他人都会受不了的，会，会的。\n 这只是没有，如果生活，它是相反的那种坚忍不拔的方法，不试图控制你无法控制的事情。\n 不像其他人那样控制你无法控制的事情。\n 所以，不，我的意思是我被禁止在国内的赌场，但这并不是因为我在做什么\n 或只是有一次我得到了，你知道，被认可，然后一个地方说不，谢谢你，然后\n 我在他们的系统上，所以所有其他使用相同安全系统的赌场，如果我试图\n 如果我试图进入一个，他们会说，哦，不，对不起，你可以吃东西，但你不能玩这个游戏。\n 游戏。\n 所以，你知道，为什么我提到赌场？\n 只是，是的，我不在那里做生活中的事情，因为这不是真的，我不认为是\n 我想，这不是生活的方式。\n 我认为，一般来说，我读到的大多数东西，都是这些技巧的一种。\n 诱惑技巧，如何让人们觉得他们是，你知道，如何表现得像\n 你在听别人说话，只是听，只是听那个人说话。\n 你不必反映他们的身体语言和做这些，如果你听别人说话，这些东西会自然而然地出现。\n 这些事情会自然而然地发生。\n 如果你想让别人喜欢你，只是，你知道，这将是很好的，等等。\n 所以我，整个世界的排序，走向世界，用一堆的技术来控制它，真的是错误的。\n 的技术来控制它，这真的是一种误导。\n 我有很长一段时间是这样的，我想也许这部分是对它的反应，但是\n 也许我必须经历它，然后意识到，哦，那不是，那不是重点。"
